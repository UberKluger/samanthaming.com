# 4 Ways to Convert String to Character Array in JavaScript

Here are 4 ways to split a word into an array of characters. "Split" is the most common and more robust way. But with the addition of ES6, there are more tools in the JS arsenal to play with üß∞

I always like to see all the possible ways to solve something because then you can choose the best way for your use case. Also, when you see it pop up in someone's codebase, you will understand it with ease üëç‚Ä¨

```javascript
const string = 'word';

// Option 1
string.split('');

// Option 2
[...string];

// Option 3
Array.from(string);

// Option 4
Object.assign([], string);

// Result:
// ['w', 'o', 'r', 'd']
```

## Scenarios

Instead of going through the pros and cons of each different way. Let me show you the different scenarios where one is preferred over the other.

### Array of Characters

If all you're doing is wanting separate the string by each string character, all of the ways are good and will give you the same result

```javascript
const string = 'hi there';

const usingSplit = string.split('');
const usingSpread = [...string];
const usingArrayFrom = Array.from(string);
const usingObjectAssign = Object.assign([], string);

// Result
// [ 'h', 'i', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e' ]
```

### Specific Separators

If you want to split your string by a specific character, then `split` is the way to go.

```javascript
const string = 'split-by-dash';

const usingSplit = string.split('-');
// [ 'split', 'by', 'dash' ]
```

The other ways are limited by each string character only

```javascript
const string = 'split-by-dash';

const usingSpread = [...string];
const usingArrayFrom = Array.from(string);
const usingObjectAssign = Object.assign([], string);

// Result:
// [ 's', 'p', 'l', 'i', 't', '-', 'b', 'y', '-', 'd', 'a', 's', 'h' ]
```

### Strings containing Emojis

If your strings contain emojis, then `split` or `Object.assign` might not be the best choice. Let's see what happens:

```javascript
const string = 'cakeüòã';

const usingSplit = string.split('');
const usingObjectAssign = Object.assign([], string);

// Result
// [ 'c', 'a', 'k', 'e', 'ÔøΩ', 'ÔøΩ' ]
```

However, if we use the other ways, it works :

```javascript
const usingSpread = [...string];
const usingArrayFrom = Array.from(string);

// Result
// [ 'c', 'a', 'k', 'e', 'üòã' ]
```

This is because `split` (and Object.assign) separates characters by UTF-16 code units, which is problematic because emoji characters mostly have Unicode code points outside the range of a single code unit (0x0000-0xFFFF) and so are encoded as a surrogate pair and thus are stored as 2 consecutive code units. (Some older emojis have code points within the UTF-16 code unit range, e.g. U+263A &#x263a; "White smiling face", and require only a single code unit.) If we look at our yum emoji `'üòã'` (U+1F60B) it's actually made up of 2 code units (0xD83D, 0xDE0B) NOT 1 as we perceive.

```javascript
'üòã'.length; // 2
```

This is what's called [grapheme clusters](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries) - where the user perceives it as 1 single unit, but under the hood, it's in fact made up of multiple units. The newer methods `spread` and `Array.from` are better equipped to handle these because they are defined in terms of an **iterator** which, for Strings, returns each code **point** whether it is a single code **unit** or stored as a surrogate pair and so will split your string by **grapheme clusters** üëç

### A caveat about `Object.assign` ‚ö†Ô∏è

One thing to note `Object.assign` is that it doesn't actually produce a pure array. Let's start with its definition

> The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object

The key there is "copies all enumerable own properties". So what we're doing here `Object.assign([], string)` it copying ALL of our string properties over to our new array. Which means we have an Array PLUS some string methods.

#### TypeScript Test: Result array is not a `string[]` type üò±

This is more evident if we use the TypeScript Playground. Feel free to copy the code and paste in the [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play), where you can hover on the variable to view the types. Since this is just an article, I'll paste the result here so you can follow along.

```typescript
const word = 'word';

const usingSplit = string.split('');
const usingSpread = [...string];
const usingArrayFrom = Array.from(string);

// Result:
// string[] üëà Which means it's an Array of strings
```

However, if we look at the result type of `Object.assign`. It doesn't give us an Array of strings.

```javascript
const usingObjectAssign = Object.assign([], string);

// Result:
// never[] & "string" üëà which means NOT Array of strings üò±
```

#### TypeScript Test: Result array can access string properties üò±

We can do further check this by accessing a property that should only be available to a `String`.

```javascript
const string = 'string';
const array = [];

string.bold; // ‚úÖ(method) String.bold(): string
array.bold; //  ‚ùåProperty 'bold' does not exist on type
```

So that means if I call `bold` on our Array, it should tell us this property doesn't exist. This is what we expect to see:

```javascript
Array.from('string').bold;
// Property 'bold' does not exist on type
```

BUT, if we call `bold` on our supposedly Array created by `Object.assign`, it works üò±

```javascript
Object.assign([], 'string').bold;
// (method) String.bold(): string
```

‚òùÔ∏è And this is because `Object.assign` copies over ALL the properties over from the original String. Here's how I'd explain it in non-dev terms. You go to a store to buy a dog. But then store `Object.assign` sells you a dog that has dragon wings. This sounds super cool, but this isn't really a rental friendly pet. Hmm...I don't think this is my best example. But I think you get my point üòÇ

#### Conversion seems okay in browser üôÇ

Now I don't think this is a major deal-breaker, cause:

> It seems that browsers have some kind of mechanism in place to "safely" do Object.assign([], "string") and avoid adding the methods of that string to the array.

_[@CaptainOrion_](https://twitter.com/captainorion_/status/1238979904567271425?s=21):_ Turn string into char Array but using map function ü§£

```javascript
Array.prototype.map.call('word', eachLetter => eachLetter);

// ['w', 'o', 'r', 'd']
```

_[@HiUmesh2](https://twitter.com/hiumesh2/status/1239037902543355904?s=21):_ `Array.prototype.slice.call('string')` wil do the trick too

_@inside.code:_ Extra info: it's safer to use the spread operator (second method) rather than `String.prototype.split('')` (first method), because `split()` doesn't work with some uncommon characters.

_@faerberrr:_ I had a string that contained special characters like `√•√¶ƒÅƒÉ` etc. When I split them using the `.split('')` method and ran `.length`, it returned twice the expected value! Switching to the spread operator fixed the problem.
